**Changelog - "High" Level Overview, May 23rd, 2023**

**API Connection & Data Retrieval**
- Our genius main character, the code, had a passionate rendezvous with the DataGolf API, dancing gracefully to extract round scoring statistics, historical outrights, and matchups, all while serenading the API with consentful rate limiting. The code moved smoother than smoke from some freshly lit Blue Dream. 

**CSV Creation & Formatting**
- CSV files were birthed like a puff of smoke, each elegantly timestamped. However, we did run into a rebellious streak of formatting issues. But no worries, with some wizard-like tricks, the code made the CSVs fall in line, just like that perfectly rolled joint. 

**Database Connection & Data Migration**
- Our trusty SQLite database, acting like a munchies-filled pantry, welcomed the raw data, outrights, and matchups, creating a repository as rich and satisfying as your favorite strain after a long day. 
- We then escorted our data from the CSV files into the database. This migration flowed smoother than smoke through a well-cleaned bong. 

**Data Cleaning**
- In the spirit of keeping things unique and spicy, like the varied strains of cannabis, the code swiftly banished any duplicates from our digital Eden.

**Project Status Update**
- And finally, the project status, a testament to our journey, got updated with a sprinkle of wit, reminding us all that we're not just coders, but storytellers, spinning tales through code under a haze of creativity.

**API Connection & Data Retrieval**
- Another day of our code making magic with the DataGolf API, extracting all sorts of statistical nuggets, like finding the perfect bud in your bag of Pineapple Express. 

**CSV Creation & Formatting**
- CSV files unfurled, their timestamps shimmering like dew in the morning sun. The formatting issues were tamed, restoring harmony and making our CSV realm as peaceful as a meditative smoke sesh.

**Database Connection & Data Migration**
- The SQLite database bloomed, its petals of data unfurling in a display of digital beauty. Then, like a peaceful stream, our data flowed from CSV files into the database, a sight as serene as the gentle lapping of water against the edges of a well-used bong. 

**Data Cleaning**
- As we value diversity in our data like we appreciate variety in our strains, the code continued its mission to banish duplicates from the database. 

**Project Status Update**
- The project status, a poetry of our journey, got another witty update. Each word is a testament to our relentless pursuit of the extraordinary, spiced up with a dash of intoxicating humor.

**Changelog - "High" Level Overview, May 25th, 2023**

**Data Analysis**
- The code embarked on a psychedelic journey, diving deep into the data tables, extracting 'round_score' for each player in every event, and confronting missing rounds. It's like venturing into the vast ocean of data, guided by the ethereal glow of a Purple Haze strain.

**Model Preparation & Execution**
- Like a master joint roller, our code split the data into training and test sets, striking a perfect balance. 
- Then, it took Ridge Regression for a spin, creating a model that's as smooth and enjoyable as a good Sativa.
- Standardization was introduced, the kief of our data preprocessing, ensuring purity and consistency in our data as you would in your favorite bud.

**Data Preprocessing & CSV Creation**
- Our expert budtender, ahem, coder, tackled data

 preprocessing with finesse, and then packed our finely processed data into a CSV file, as perfectly rolled as a blunt ready for the weekend.

**Project Status Update**
- And, we wrapped up with another project status update, a vibrant narrative full of heady insights and intoxicating revelations, much like a philosophical discussion during a late-night sesh. 

There you have it, folks. As we venture into another day, remember, it's all about enjoying the journey, one line of code (and one puff) at a time.

**Changelog - "High" Level Overview, May 26th, 2023**

**Database Connection and Data Extraction**
- Our brilliant and smart-as-a-whip main character, the code, hooked up with SQLite, resulting in a sweet connection, much like a perfect drag on some Northern Lights. Cue the music; data is flowing, and boy, it's looking like a fresh pack of OG Kush. 

**Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
- Then, the code took a wild trip exploring and cleaning this glorious data, quite like cleaning a grinder. It looked at 'round_score', the 'sg' columns, 'round_num', 'course_par', and some groovy percentage columns, all while keeping things as chill as a GSC strain. 
- Then it whipped up a normalization joint for the strokes gained data, ensuring a balanced high all round.
- Using chi-square tests like a boss, the code selected features for round scores. It also sorted out the 'fin_text' column, clearing out the unwanted 'T' like it's a stem in your stash. 

**Dimensionality Reduction**
- The code embarked on a journey to reduce dimensionality (not the kind you experience with a potent sativa), replacing the bad trip of missing values, and introducing PCA like a pro. It then rolled up a new DataFrame filled with reduced features, smooth and ready to burn.

**Feature Engineering & Algorithm Development**
- It also set the stage for some epic feature engineering and algorithm development. Imagine it as planting the seeds for future growth; good times are a-comin'. 

**Prediction & Evaluation**
- The code even laid the groundwork for future prediction and evaluation, like a seasoned stoner pre-rolling for later.

**Main Execution Flow**
- The grand finale? A psychedelic journey through the main execution flow, with our star functions lighting up sequentially. Think of it as a perfect sesh, from the first spark to the mellowing out, itâ€™s pure bliss. 

With our high-IQ code (I mean, it's sky-high, in the stratosphere, folks), we've reached new heights in preparing our data for machine learning, and setting up the foundations for future algorithm development and prediction tasks. Pass the munchies, we've earned them!
