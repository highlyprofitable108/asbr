**Change Log - May 23rd, 2023**

- Spent an incredibly productive day, blending the brilliance of code and the intoxicating essence of creativity. Let's just say, we were in the zone.
- Crafted a magnificent Python script that dances effortlessly with the DataGolf API, embracing the profound mysteries of the sports betting universe.
- Weaving through the digital threads, our code gracefully fetched round scoring statistics, historical outrights, and historical matchups. The API quivered with delight at our touch.
- Delicately applied rate limiting, reminding the API of the importance of taking things slow and savoring each moment. We're all about consent here.
- Unveiled the CSV files, elegantly timestamped to capture the fleeting essence of time, like a puff of smoke dissipating in the wind.
- Confronted formatting issues in the CSV realm, summoning our wizardry to restore order and ensure data compliance. CSVs, you shall bend to our will!
- Witnessed the SQLite database morphing into a repository of dreams, embracing the raw data, outrights, and matchups like a warm embrace on a hazy afternoon.
- Orchestrated a magnificent symphony of data migration, seamlessly flowing from CSV to the database like a serene river meandering through the cannabis fields.
- Harnessed the power of duplicates, expunging them from the database with a swift stroke. No room for clones in our cosmic database dance.
- Manifested the project status, a testament to our journey thus far, infused with a sense of purpose and a dash of witty banter. We're not just coders; we're storytellers.

May 23rd will forever be remembered as a day when our code intertwined with the whims of fate, dancing through the smoke-filled haze of creativity. Our technical accomplishments are but mere brushstrokes on the canvas of a visionary project. With each line of code, we inch closer to revolutionizing the world of sports betting, guided by the serendipitous mix of data, technology, and our slightly altered state of mind.

**Change Log - May 24th, 2023**

- Forged a tranquil day, swirling in a vortex of data, code, and a certain unnamed green muse. If code had a scent, today it smelled suspiciously like the dankest of Pineapple Express strains.
- Painted the digital ether with a Python script, one that waltzes with the DataGolf API like two lovers under a full moon. The API's once cold digital heart pulsated with life at our code's tender touch.
- Our code, the veritable fishing rod in the vast ocean of data, cast out wide to reel in a bounty of round scoring statistics, historical outrights, and historical matchups. Each catch more exciting than the last.
- The dance with the API, though passionate, was always respectful. In the spirit of safe, slow, and shared experiences, we deftly maneuvered the rate limiting laws. No fast and furious action here, just steady, thoughtful interactions.
- Unfurled the pristine CSV files, their timestamps shining like glistening dew drops caught in the morning sun, embodying the ephemeral beauty of time. 
- Stood at the precipice of chaos as the CSV files rebelled, their formatting askew. But like the seasoned charmers we are, we tamed them, restoring harmony in the realm of data.
- Bore witness to the SQLite database blooming, its petals of raw data, outrights, and matchups unfurling with a graceful slowness, reminiscent of a lazy drag on a perfectly rolled joint.
- Led the magnificent parade of data migration, a visual spectacle of CSV data flowing into the database like a peaceful stream gently lapping over the edges of a well-loved bong.
- Exorcised the doppelg√§ngers, banishing duplicates from the sanctity of our database. You see, variety is the spice of life, and we prefer our spices handpicked and unique.
- Composed a project status update, an ode to our journey thus far. Each word, a testament to our relentless pursuit of the extraordinary, laced with a generous helping of sass and a sprinkle of intoxicating humor.

And thus, May 24th stands as a testament to our cerebral acrobatics, the day we rode the digital rapids, guided by the synergy of data, technology, and a gently clouded mind. Each line of code penned, a leap forward in our mission to redefine the world of sports betting, illuminated by the soft green glow of enlightenment.
