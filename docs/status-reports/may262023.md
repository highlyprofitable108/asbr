**Project Status - May 26th, 2023**

- **Connecting & Fetching:** Our SQL code hit the database jackpot and hauled in a healthy pile of data. 

- **Cleaning & Sorting:** Like a meticulous gardener tending to the data fields, we've weeded out the bad elements and have the good stuff sparkling.

- **Betting on the Right Features:** We played our hand with chi-square and ridge regression. Our pot's looking good with these feature selection techniques.

Yet, we're still holding a few cards that need to be played:

- **Data Sampling:** We've yet to roll the dice on handling imbalanced datasets.

- **Handling Skewed Data:** Need to straighten out the skewed. Right now, it's like a dice that's heavier on one side.

- **Spotting and Handling Outliers:** It's like finding that rigged card in a deck - still a work in progress.

- **Optimal Simulation:** We're still figuring out our game strategy here.

- **Mutual Information Feature Selection:** It's like counting cards, but we haven't started.

- **Feature Engineering, Algorithm Development, Predictions, Evaluation:** These sections are like unplayed chips on the table.

**The Game Plan:**

1. Put our chips down on completing the placeholders in the preprocessing function. Let's handle data sampling, skewing, outliers, and feature selection.

2. It's time to go all-in on feature engineering. Let's make some strategic moves to generate new, game-changing features.

3. Let's bet on the right algorithm, train our model, and see where the cards fall.

4. Double down on our prediction function, getting it ready to call the shots on future tournaments.

5. Implement an evaluation function. It's time to check our hand and see if our bets paid off.

6. Develop a better system to catch our bluffs. We need efficient logging and exception handling.

7. Execute some dry runs. Make sure our strategy is sound and we're not walking into a game we can't win.

8. Ace the methods for optimal simulation. 

Remember, the house always wins if the code isn't clean, concise, and well-commented. And we don't like losing. So, let's shuffle up and deal!
