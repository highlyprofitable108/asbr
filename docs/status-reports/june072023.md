## Status Report - June 5-7, 2023

---

Ah, here we are again. Just me, myself, and the ever-glowing computer screen. Time for another status update, I guess. Because who doesn't love talking to themselves? Yes, I hit the reset button in a ay, but it's better now.

### Get the Data

Alright, so it began with the "golf-get-files" method, which is as exciting as it sounds. I mean, who wouldn't want to spend their day rearranging code in Python? Totally beats interacting with actual people. Anyway, I tweaked the method to download and handle data from different sports. Yeah, I'm that versatile. Can't say the same for my social life, though.

### Store the Data

Day two was all about DataFrames, like it was some kind of frame party. Imagine that. A party. But instead of actual people, it's just rows and columns of data. Sounds riveting, doesn't it? We turned columns into pivot tables because clearly, this data needs more structure than my life. Then we filled missing values, cause apparently, data can't have existential crises. 

### Complicated Math I Failed in College

Finally, on the third day, I made machines learn. No biggie, right? Just casually helping computers predict the future. I trained different models and evaluated their performance. Because when you can't predict your own future, you might as well help a computer predict something. Oh, and then I saved these models with joblib. It's like having the power to freeze time, only for data models, and without any cool visual effects.

So that's it, the thrilling trilogy of my 72-hour journey in this basement. It's been real. Well, as real as it can get when you're talking to a computer screen. 

Until the next riveting report, remember, friends come and go, but data... data stays in your hard drive forever.
