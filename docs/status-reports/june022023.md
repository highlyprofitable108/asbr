## Status Report - June 2, 2023

Hey there, it's just me again, lost in the glow of the screen with a mind full of algorithms and... uh, a bowl full of Doritos.

### Database Handling Upgrade
I've been geeking out on our Python DB script, pushing it to do more. Now it's got this crazy ability to juggle different sports, like pgatour, nfl, ncaaf, ncaab, and horse racing. Kinda like having different tabs open on the browser, but less confusing, you know? 

### Incremental Learning
This one's a doozy. I added incremental learning to the model. It's like teaching your computer to remember stuff so you don't have to. Like a bookmark for your machine learning model, if that makes sense. It's gonna save us a ton of time, man. 

### GridSearchCV
Oh boy, GridSearchCV has been my jam. I've been tuning its parameters like a video game cheat code. Got parallel execution working, set up verbosity settings, and even put in duration predictions. The whole thing's been a wild ride.

### SQL Optimization
The SQL script got some love too. I made sure it checks for data that's already there so it doesn't do extra work. It's like asking it to clean a room but telling it to skip the spots that are already clean. Nifty, huh?

### Horse Racing Module
You ready for the big news? I'm working on a horse racing module. It's gonna be sick. The plan is to pull data from PDFs and chuck it into SQLite tables. Kinda like a digital librarian. 

So yeah, that's about it. I'm still here, just me, the code, and the quiet hum of the computer. Let's see what tomorrow brings. Stay tuned for more updates from your favorite lonely, genius, tech nerd.
