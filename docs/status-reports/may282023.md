### Status Update - May 28th

We've made significant progress in our journey of developing a predictive model for golf tournaments. The functions to engineer features, develop algorithms, gather player data, predict future tournaments, and evaluate predictions have been refined, setting up a solid framework for our system.

There's been a stumbling block with the 'tensorflow' module which we believe can be addressed with some adjustments or a new setup. The importance of this module is significant for the operation of our deep learning model, and thus it's crucial that we overcome this hurdle.

The main execution flow of our program, from connecting to the database to evaluating our model's predictions, has been successfully laid out. We've put in place appropriate exception handling to ensure our system is robust and reliable.

### Next Steps:

**Addressing the 'TensorFlow' issue**: The first step is to troubleshoot and resolve the 'tensorflow' issue that was encountered. This will likely involve installing or setting up the module in the development environment. 

**Testing**: Once the 'tensorflow' issue is resolved, we will test each function individually to make sure they are working as expected. This includes not only their main functionality but also their handling of edge cases and unexpected inputs.

**Integration and End-to-end Testing**: After individual testing, we will proceed with integration testing where we verify that these functions work correctly when used together. This involves executing the main flow of the program and making sure the output is as expected.

**Performance Optimization**: Based on the results from our tests, we might need to optimize certain parts of the code for better performance. This could involve refining our feature engineering or tuning hyperparameters of our models.

**Enhancements**: Once we have a working and optimized system, we can think about potential enhancements. This could involve adding more features to our model, expanding the data we're using for predictions, or improving the user interface.

**Compilation**: Finally, once we have a fully tested, optimized, and enhanced system, we will compile our program. This will involve packaging all the necessary parts into a single executable or script that can be run without requiring access to the source code or the development environment. 

Remember, these steps might not occur strictly in this order. It's common to iterate between stages, especially testing and optimization, to continuously improve the system.
