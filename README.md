# Golf Tournament Analysis and Simulation

This project aims to analyze golf tournament data, build predictive models, and simulate tournament outcomes based on historical data. It provides tools for data handling, modeling, and simulation to gain insights into player performance and predict tournament results.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model training and evaluation
- Simulation of tournament outcomes
- Database operations for data storage and retrieval
- API integration for field updates
- Output generation and saving

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, joblib, sqlite3

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/golf-tournament-analysis.git
cd golf-tournament-analysis
```

2. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure the project settings:

   - Open the `constants.py` file and set the appropriate values for the constants, such as database paths, API keys, output directories, etc.

4. Prepare the data:

   - Ensure the necessary data is available in the SQLite database.
   - If required, populate the database tables with historical data using the provided database operations functions.

5. Train the model:

   - Run the `train_model.py` script to train the regression model based on the available data. The script will save the trained model in the specified model directory.

6. Run simulations:

   - Execute the `simulate_tournament.py` script to simulate tournament outcomes. The script will load the most recent trained regression model, fetch field updates from the API, perform data preprocessing, run simulations, and save the consolidated results in the specified output directory.

## Usage

- Data analysis and model training:

  - Use the provided functions in `data_analysis.py` and `model_training.py` to explore the data, perform analysis, and train models.

- Simulation:

  - The `simulate_tournament.py` script is the main entry point for running simulations. Adjust the simulation parameters in `constants.py` as needed.

- Database operations:

  - Use the provided functions in `database_operations.py` to interact with the SQLite database, such as fetching round scoring data, populating player and course statistics, and backing up the database.

- API integration:

  - The `utils/api_utils.py` module contains functions to make API calls and retrieve field updates for the tournaments.
